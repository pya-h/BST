# Binary Search Tree
Implementing binary search trees;

# Language: C++
# bst.cpp
This code contains an impolementation of BST;

# largest-bst
This one gets an tree input which can or can not be a bst;
The program tries to calculate the length of the maximum sub tree in this input tree, That is infact a binary search tree.

# least-difference-bst
This one i think was originally written to calculate the minimum difference of the items across each brance in a binary search tree.
